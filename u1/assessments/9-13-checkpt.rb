# Checkpoint Challenge: While Loops and Conditional statements (15 minutes)

# The user needs to select an option from a list of options.
# Give them 3-5 options, number them 1-5 (or however many options)
    # These can be a list of anything, e.g favorite potato chips, musicians, etc.
# If they do NOT select one of the items:
    # Tell them their choice is invalid and prompt them with acceptable input.
# Say goodbye once they have selected a valid option.

# If time: tell them the order they selected before saying goodbye (for e.g. 1 = cheeseburger, so say "Thanks for your order of a cheeseburger")
